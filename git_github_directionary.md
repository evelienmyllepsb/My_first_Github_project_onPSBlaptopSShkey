# Git & GitHub Dictionary

- Git: a versioning system that keeps track of changes - allows you to go back, allows for collaboration, is locally stored

- GitHub: where we can access other's files, online repository for your codes (not only) Back up place for your rgit projects.  cloud based located...remote
  
  dfddf

# Commands

- git init --> is going to initialize my timeline (my git rep)

- git add --> 

- git commit -m "meaningful msg"  -->  saves the update version (snapshot/point in time) in the git repo

- ### Saving a point in time

- ```
  
  ```

```
### Where do I develop a project?

Conceptual areas

### Conceptual areas

1. Developing area: the working directory

2. staging area: temporary space to store file before comiting to the local repo

3. local repo: 

4.

# Goal

·       So, Github is not only for
codes?  Also for documents?  
We will get the github course in github

·       We will NOT talk about contribute to
an open-source project. 

# Unix basic introduction

·       Pwd and path

·       Language is Case sensitive.  Never a space in your folder or text name. Use
f.ex. MilkBread or Milk_Bread or Milk-Bread

·       Use tab key to auto-complete a
folder or file name

·       ls and cd

# Introduction to Git and Github

## Project Developing my own

tutorial

·       Marktext:

# Title

## Subtitle

à this
is allowing to track everyting, (with word you don’t see what is going on
behind the scenes)  Marktext is more
visual and more easy to follow. (nice visual way)

SO open marktext, you can choose to see the commands behind the text  
à  
@ will give you a list with all the codes  
Text has .dm as extension  
à We
use this to be able to write a nice text, as in visual code you have to know
yourself the codes if you want a nice way of writing

·       Problem: work with different persons
on same document.  You will save it as
v1, v2, V3, but at the end you will probably not know which is the final
version.  

·       Solution: Git Repository =
timeline!!!  So first learn how to make a
timeline, and also how to get back into time  
Difference with google documents, is that you define the moments when there is
a ‘commit’ = timepoint that you can go back.  SO it is saved all the times, but not every change is a different
document.  With google docus

·       GitHub : backup of your timeline  
What is different between Git Repository and GitHub?  See marktext

·       This document is saved locally, but
is NOT yet in the cloud!! It’s not yet a timepoint in github!!

·       Use VS code (Visual Studio Code)

·       Check ssh keym make sure to have it

·       Make sure to choose as language Git
Bash, not PowerShell (as this is a windows things).  By clicking on the arrow you can choose the other
language (Git Bash).

·       You need to go to your project C:\Users\evmyl\Desktop\My_first_Github_project  
But in the command code you have to type it differently

### You need to do with ungit

So install
first, type ungit, and than you see there what is going on in the github.  You see there if you created an extra
timepoint or commit

### Starting my timeline

·       Initialize git: git init  
This means that git can see everything what is happening in the folder we initialized.  He can NOT see anything what was from before.

### Kdkkdkd

See slides

### Saving a point in time

·       This is taking a snapshot

·       Git commit  - m “meaningful message”

·       Do NOT Initialize Git inside this subfolder
as well!!!!

## Where is GitHub

·       Git is in your computer

·       Github is in the cloud!!!

·       It’s a link between a github project
in your computer

## Where is git in your

computer?

## Where do I develop a

project?

In your
computer

## Where is the timeline?

·       Develop area

·       Local repository

·       A git repository: where you save
snapshots

·       Git add : to add a channel to the
timeline

·       So always git add, than git
commit  (git add is putting it in to the
staging area, git commit is putting it into the local repository)

We made
second timepoint, and than I got the following error.

Than I
needed to follow these two commands.

Than he asks
you your name and emailadress.

You need to
do this for each project once.

## Where is my context?

Git status

Could be:

·       Verify Uncommited changes

·       Verify staged and unstaged changes

·       Verify

You can see
here the status.

Says that
some files are not tracked yet.  So than
it’s good to track them.

So, your
two documents are added to the (repisotory’??) à so only from now it will be
tracked.  (it’s on the timeline)

Now, you
see that they are not yet comitted.

Git add :
putting them in the staging area

Git comit:

à you
can compare this with library.  All books
that come in get classified, they go in the box with f.ex. country books, romans,
…  This is staging area!!!  (this is a stage where you can structure it)

Bringing
the books from the box to the shelves.  This
is comit.

So, you
should do always all two of them.

Now they
are also committed.  With one command both
files are done!!

# Collaboration



1. Go to GitHub > Respository > Settings > Access > Collaborators.

2. Add the collaborator and send an invite.

3. Use `git clone <SSH repo>` into a NEW folder to take all the files from the remote repo of your collaborator.
   
   ```git
   git clone git@github.com:evelienmyllepsb/My_first_Github_project_onPSBlaptopSShkey.git
   ```

4. Check your local repository to see if all the files are there!
